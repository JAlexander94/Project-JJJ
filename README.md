## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The aim of the project was to make a 5 day weather forecast which saved the cities you had searched for in local storage so that they were there when you come back to the site

The project specifically wanted the user to be able to:

- When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    The city name
    The date
    An icon representation of weather conditions
    The temperature
    The humidity
    The wind speed
- When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    The date
    An icon representation of weather conditions
    The temperature
    The humidity
- When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
